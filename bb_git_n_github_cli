# barebones outline of workflow for working with git and github via cli 
# extremely basic progression to aid in getting comfortable with how git and github work 

## create a new repository 

* via web/gui:
see https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/

* via cli:
curl -u 'USER' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"REPO"}'
# Remember replace USER with your username and REPO with your repository/application name!
git remote add origin git@github.com:USER/REPO.git
git push origin master

## add project to new repository
  - initialize directory
  - add/stage local files for commit
  - add and verify url of lremote repo
  - push changes to github

cd <projectDirectory>
git init (initializes local directory as git repo)
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourAccount/remoteRepoUrl.git
git push origin master

## ongoing integration between local and remote repos

git pull
